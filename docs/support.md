# Support

If you are experiencing technical difficulties while writing code or interacting with the Solana blockchain, ask your question on [StackExchange](https://solana.stackexchange.com) (tag your question with `farms`), or reach out to solana.farms@protonmail.com and provide your name, a link to the project website (if there is one), and a detailed description of the problem.

If you found a bug in the code, you can raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/solana-labs/farms). But if this is a security issue, please don't open it on Github or disclose it in public channels. Send information to the email above instead.
